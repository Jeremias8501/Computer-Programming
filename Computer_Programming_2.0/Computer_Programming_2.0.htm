                        <h3>Low-level  programming language</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>-is machine-dependent(1s and 0s)  programming language.</li>
                            <li>-The processor runs low-level programs directly without the need of a COMPILER or INTERPRETER so Low-level language can be very fast</li>
                            
                        </ul>
                    <h4>Two parts of the Low-Level Language</h4>
                        <li>Machine language<br>
                            - "Machine code or subject code"<br>
                            - easier to read because it is normally displayed in binary of hexadecimal  
                              form<br>
                            - does not need a translator to convert programs</li>
                        <li>b. Assembly language(ASM)-designed for specific processors. It      
                            represents the set of instructions in a symbolic and human- 
                            understandable form. Uses the assembler to convert the assemble 
                            language to machine language.
                            The advantage of both is that require less memory execution time and  
                            program</li>
                    </ol>


                </li>
                <li>
                     <h3>High Level Language Programming </h3>-requires compiler or interpreter. Designed for developing user-friendly software programs and websites.<br>Compilers- translate the high level instructions into 1s and 0s<br>Interpreters- translate the program line by line as the program is runnin
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>High level language allow programmers to use English-like instructions.</h3>
                    <ol type="a">
                        
                        <li>Procedural Oriented Programming-is derived from the structured programming and based upon the procedure call concepts. It divides a program into a small procedures called routines and functions.</p>
                            <p>-used by the software programmer editor like IDE, Adobe Dreamweaver of Microsoft Visual Studio</p>
                            <p>-Advantage of POP, helps the programmers to easily track the program flow and can be  reused</li>
                        <li>Object Oriented Programming</p>
                            <p>-based upon the objects<br>
                            -programs divided into small parts called objects<br>
                            -faster and easier to execute, maintain, modify, as well as debug.</li>
                        <li>Natural Language</p>
                            <p>-is a part of human languages such as English, Russian, German, and Japanese. It is used by machines to understand, manipulate, and interpret human's language.<br>
                            -helps users to ask questions in any subjects</li>
