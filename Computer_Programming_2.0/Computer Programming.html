                <!--Definition-->
                <p>Computer Programming<br>-is the process that professionals use to write code that instructs how a computer, application, or software program performs.</p>
                <p>Programs<br>-is a program or application made by the programmers by the use of the programming language.</p>
                <p>Programmers<br>- are the one who put the programming languages to create programs</p>
                <p>Programming Language<br>
                - is the language use to develop programs 
                </p>

                <h2>Types of programming Languages </h2>
                <div>
                    <div class="1">
                        <h3>1.Low-level  programming language</h3>
                        <p>-is machine-dependent(1s and 0s)  programming language.<br>
                        -The processor runs low-level programs directly without the need of a COMPILER or INTERPRETER so Low-level language can be very fast</p>
                        <div>
                            <h4>Two parts of the Low-Level Language</h4>


                            <div>
                                <div class="a">
                                    <p>a. Machine language<br>
                                    - "Machine code or subject code"<br>
                                    - easier to read because it is normally displayed in binary of hexadecimal  
                                      form<br>
                                    - does not need a translator to convert programs</p>
                                </div>


                                <div class="b">
                                    <p>b. Assembly language(ASM)-designed for specific processors. It      
                                        represents the set of instructions in a symbolic and human- 
                                        understandable form. Uses the assembler to convert the assemble 
                                        language to machine language.
                                        The advantage of both is that require less memory execution time and  
                                        program</p>

                        <p>2. High Level Language Programming -requires compiler or interpreter. Designed for developing user-friendly software programs and websites.<br>Compilers- translate the high level instructions into 1s and 0s<br>Interpreters- translate the program line by line as the program is runnin</p>
                    <div class="3">
                        <p>3.High level language allow programmers to use English-like instructions.</p>

                                a. Procedural Oriented Programming-is derived from the structured programming and based upon the procedure call concepts. It divides a program into a small procedures called routines and functions.</p>
                                <p>-used by the software programmer editor like IDE, Adobe Dreamweaver of Microsoft Visual Studio</p>
                                <p>-Advantage of POP, helps the programmers to easily track the program flow and can be  reused.

                                <p>-based upon the objects<br>
                                -programs divided into small parts called objects<br>
                                -faster and easier to execute, maintain, modify, as well as debug.</p>

                                <p>-is a part of human languages such as English, Russian, German, and Japanese. It is used by machines to understand, manipulate, and interpret human's language.<br>
                                -helps users to ask questions in any subject</p>
